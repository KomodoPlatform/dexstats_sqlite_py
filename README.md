The goal of this project is to provide all required data from AtomicDEX network to match [CMC "Ideal endpoint"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4urpzUnO2t7DmS_1dc4EL4tgnnbTObPYXvDeBnukCg/edit#) criteria. python3.7+ and pip requirements from `requirements.txt` needed.

As data source using AtomicDEX-API SQLite (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/796), and seednode data where pubkeys info is required.

It also requires https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API running on the same host for orderbooks retreiving (supposed to work on seednode which collecting swap statuses). For remote connection tweak `mm2_host` in `stats_utils.py`
