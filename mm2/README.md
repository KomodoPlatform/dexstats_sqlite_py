You will need to download mm2 binary and coins file into this folder, and create an MM2.json file.

- Use `update_mm2.sh` to get the latest mm2 binary release (linux)
- Use `update_coins.sh` to get the latest coins file (this will also be periodically once a day while running the API)
- Use `update_db.sh` to rsync the latest db file from the server. You may need to edit the script to point to a server you have access to.
