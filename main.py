It allows users to send, receive, and trade numerous coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB and ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens. With AtomicDEX, there is no need to download the whole blockchain in the process. One of the AtomicDEX walletâ€™s main features is the use of a 24-word seed phrase that has to be kept safe or to be remembered by the user, as it is required to recover funds in the event of a forgotten password. The decentralized exchange on AtomicDEX uses P2P order books powered by atomic swaps that enable the transfer of cryptocurrency from one party to another, without the use of a third-party intermediary. AtomicDEX is one of the ecosystem products built with Komodo AtomicDEX API - an open-source framework that is compatible with 99% of cryptocurrencies. DogeDEX and GleecDEX are two additional examples of products that use Komodo AtomicDEX API. Try AtomicDEX Beta on any platform and start making atomic swaps today.",
